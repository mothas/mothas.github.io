[Cod Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudophilosophy){:target="_blank"} is an idea I subscribe to. The first time I heard about Cod Philosophy (Cod from the word _codswallop_; not cod fish) is in a song by one of my favorite band [Porcupine Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_Tree){:target="_blank"}. It really is just another term for Pseudophilosophy. As I'm not a huge fan of formal Philosophy, the term Cod Philosophy struck me early on.

After years of toiling with computers, I have come up with failsafe Cod(e) Philosophy. All this while, I've been sharing with a few over conversations. But the time has arrived to share with my Code Philosophy with the rest of the world. In my opinion, there are 2 principles that constitutes my Code Philosophy. They are:

* Be Lazy
* Do Not Trust Yourself

Plain and simple! And seemingly ridiculous. But let me explain why I think it's an important mindset to adopt.
